              <div class="faq-panel">
                <p class="faq-panel" style="margin-top: 1.25em; margin-bottom: 2.5em">
                  Certainly! LED neon signs differ from traditional glass neon in several key ways. They are more
                  durable and energy-efficient, making them a safer and more cost-effective choice. LED neon is made
                  from flexible tubing that's less prone to breaking, easier to install, and requires minimal
                  maintenance. Additionally, LED signs offer greater customization options and a longer lifespan
                  compared to their glass counterparts. While both have their aesthetic appeal, the practical benefits
                  of LED neon make it a popular choice for modern decor needs.

                  We include a cleaning guide in every package we ship but in case you lost it here is the cleaning
                  process in a few easy steps. For mor information visit our cleaning guide page.

                  To clean your neon sign, first ensure it is turned off and unplugged from the power source for safety.
                  Gently wipe the surface with a soft, dry cloth to remove dust. If needed, you can slightly dampen the
                  cloth with water, but avoid using harsh chemicals or abrasive cleaners that could damage the sign.
                  After wiping, if you've used a damp cloth, gently dry the sign with another soft, dry cloth. It's
                  important to handle the sign gently during cleaning to prevent any bending or breaking of its parts.
                  Regular, gentle cleaning will help maintain the sign's brightness and clarity, prolonging its
                  lifespan.

                  Neon signs from Renart Decor are designed for ease of maintenance. Regular dusting with a soft, dry
                  cloth is generally all that's needed to keep your sign looking its best. It's important to handle the
                  sign gently, especially when moving or adjusting it, to protect the neon tubing and electrical
                  components. Ensure the sign is operated according to the instructions and connected to an appropriate
                  power source. Avoid exposing the sign to moisture, as this can damage the electronics. Also,
                  periodically inspect the power connections and cords for wear or damage, replacing them as necessary.
                  With these simple care steps, your neon sign will continue to illuminate your space beautifully for
                  years.

                  Neon signs from Renart Decor are primarily made using LED technology. The "neon" part of the sign is
                  crafted from flexible LED neon tubing, which is a durable and energy-efficient alternative to
                  traditional glass neon. This tubing is made of materials that are both flexible and resilient,
                  allowing for a wide range of custom shapes and designs. Inside the tubing, LED lights provide the
                  bright, vibrant glow that mimics the classic neon look. The signs are often mounted on backboards,
                  which can be made of various materials depending on the design and customer preference

                  Neon signs are mainly powered by electricity. They are designed to be plugged into a standard
                  electrical outlet using a power adapter. The LED technology in these signs is highly energy-efficient,
                  consuming significantly less power than traditional glass neon signs. We also offer a battery box at
                  additional cost if you need to use your sign outdoors where no electric outlet is available.

                  Our neon signs are made with our customerâ€™s preference in mind. Our indoor neon signs are meant to be
                  used indoor-only. They are not water-resistant but are durable enough if taken well care of in dry
                  weathers. Our outdoor neon signs on the other hand are water resistant and will be more durable.
                  However, please note that outdoor signs will still need to be taken well care of to prolong its life.
                  Extensive exposure to sun or rain should be avoided.

                  Itâ€™s extremely easy! We have three different options for you:
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  1. Design your own neon sign: Use our customizer to choose any font, color, size or text youâ€™d like
                  and weâ€™ll create the neon sign of your dreams. <br>
                  2. Upload your design: You can share your artwork or logo with us so our in-house designers can turn
                  them into a neon design. Weâ€™ll then share a free mock-up and provide a quote with you. Upon your
                  confirmation, weâ€™ll start working on your sign. <br>
                  3. Shop ready-made designs: Our in-house designers created hundreds of ready-made designs with our
                  customersâ€™ needs in mind. You can find everything from bar signs to motivational quote signs in our
                  ready-made neon sign collections.
