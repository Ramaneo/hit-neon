                  LED neon signs are more durable and energy-efficient, which makes them a safer and more cost-effective
                  choice. LED neon is made from flexible tubing that's less prone to breaking and easier to install and
                  maintain. Additionally, LED signs offer more customization options and a longer lifespan compared to
                  their glass counterparts. While both have their aesthetic appeal, the practical benefits of LED neon
                  make it a popular choice for modern needs.

                  Absolutely. Most neon signs used today are LED neon signs, which are safe for homes with children and

                  to place the sign where curious hands and playful paws can't reach it.

                  We include a cleaning guide in every package we ship, but in case you have lost it, here is the
                  cleaning process in a few easy steps:<br>

                  1. To clean your neon sign, first ensure it is turned off and unplugged from the power source for
                  safety.<br>
                  2. Gently wipe the surface with a soft, dry cloth to remove dust. If needed, you can slightly dampen
                  the cloth with water but avoid using harsh chemicals or abrasive cleaners that could damage the sign.<br>
                  3. After wiping, if you've used a damp cloth, gently dry the sign with another soft, dry cloth.<br>
                  It's important to handle the sign gently during cleaning to prevent any bending or breaking of its
                  parts. Regular cleaning will help maintain the sign's brightness and durability.

                  Neon signs from HitNeon are designed to be easy to maintain. Regular dusting with a soft, dry cloth is
                  generally all that's needed to keep your sign looking its best. It's important to handle the sign
                  gently, especially when moving or adjusting it, to protect the neon tubing and electrical components.
                  Ensure the sign is operated according to the instructions and connected to an appropriate power
                  source. Avoid exposing the sign to moisture as this can damage the electronics. Also, periodically
                  inspect the power connections and cords for wear or damage, and replace them as necessary. With these
                  simple care steps, your neon sign will continue to illuminate your space beautifully for years.

                  Neon signs from HitNeon are primarily made using LED technology. The "neon" part of the sign is
                  crafted from flexible LED neon tubing, which is a durable and energy-efficient alternative to
                  traditional glass neon. This tubing is made of materials that are both flexible and resilient,
                  allowing for a wide range of custom shapes and designs. Inside the tubing, LED lights provide the
                  bright, vibrant glow that mimics the classic neon look. The signs are often mounted on backboards,
                  which can be made of various materials depending on the design and customer preferences.

                  Neon signs are mainly powered by electricity. They are designed to be plugged into a standard
                  electrical outlet using a power adapter. The LED technology in these signs is highly energy-efficient,
                  consuming significantly less power than traditional glass neon signs. If you need to use your sign
                  outdoors where no electric outlet is available, we also offer a battery box at additional cost.

                  more durable. However, please note that outdoor signs will still need to be taken well care of to
                  prolong its life. Extensive exposure to the sun or rain should be avoided.

                  It’s extremely easy! We have three different options for you:
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  1. Design your own neon sign: Use our customizer to choose any font, color, size or text you’d like
                  and we’ll create the neon sign of your dreams. <br>
                  2. Upload your design: You can share your artwork or logo with us so our in-house designers can turn
                  them into a neon design. We’ll then share a free mock-up and provide a quote with you. Upon your
                  confirmation, we’ll start working on your sign. <br>
                  3. Shop ready-made designs: Our in-house designers created hundreds of ready-made designs with our
                  customers’ needs in mind. You can find everything from bar signs to motivational quote signs in our
                  ready-made neon sign collections.
