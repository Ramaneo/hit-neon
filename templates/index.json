Gently wipe the surface with a soft, dry cloth to remove dust. If needed, you can slightly dampen the cloth with water, but avoid using harsh chemicals or abrasive cleaners that could damage the sign. After wiping, if you've used a damp cloth, gently dry the sign with another soft, dry cloth. It's important to handle the sign gently during cleaning to prevent any bending or breaking of its parts. Regular, gentle cleaning will help maintain the sign's brightness and clarity, prolonging its lifespan.<\/p><p><strong>What maintenance does neon signs require?<\/strong><\/p><p>Neon signs from Renart Decor are designed for ease of maintenance. Regular dusting with a soft, dry cloth is generally all that's needed to keep your sign looking its best. It's important to handle the sign gently, especially when moving or adjusting it, to protect the neon tubing and electrical components. Ensure the sign is operated according to the instructions and connected to an appropriate power source. Avoid exposing the sign to moisture, as this can damage the electronics. Also, periodically inspect the power connections and cords for wear or damage, replacing them as necessary. With these simple care steps, your neon sign will continue to illuminate your space beautifully for years.<\/p>",

If you need a custom color feel free to reach out and we’ll see what we can do about it. Multi-color signs are also available at an extra cost.<\/p><p><strong>What are neon signs made of?<\/strong><\/p><p>Neon signs from Renart Decor are primarily made using LED technology. The \"neon\" part of the sign is crafted from flexible LED neon tubing, which is a durable and energy-efficient alternative to traditional glass neon. This tubing is made of materials that are both flexible and resilient, allowing for a wide range of custom shapes and designs. Inside the tubing, LED lights provide the bright, vibrant glow that mimics the classic neon look. The signs are often mounted on backboards, which can be made of various materials depending on the design and customer preference<\/p><p><strong>How are neon signs powered?<\/strong><\/p><p>Neon signs are mainly powered by electricity. They are designed to be plugged into a standard electrical outlet using a power adapter. The LED technology in these signs is highly energy-efficient, consuming significantly less power than traditional glass neon signs. We also offer a battery box at additional cost if you need to use your sign outdoors where no electric outlet is available. <\/p><p><strong>Can neon signs be used outdoors?<\/strong><\/p><p>Our neon signs are made with our customer’s preference in mind. Our indoor neon signs are meant to be used indoor-only. They are not water-resistant but are durable enough if taken well care of in dry weathers. Our outdoor neon signs on the other hand are water resistant and will be more durable. However, please note that outdoor signs will still need to be taken well care of to prolong its life. Extensive exposure to sun or rain should be avoided.<\/p>",
